<h1>[Google] Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

Business Objective/Task:
My objective for this project is to analyze the usage patterns and behavior of annual members and casual riders of Cyclistic bikes in order to design effective marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

Description:
As a data analyst at Cyclistic, I have been tasked with analyzing the historical trip data from the previous 12 months. The data includes information on bike rides, such as the ride duration, day of the week, bike type, and membership type (annual or casual). I will utilize various data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

First, I imported the trip data from the individual monthly datasets and combined them into a single dataset called "combined_data." I then performed data cleaning and removed unnecessary columns related to latitude, longitude, and station information.

Next, I conducted exploratory data analysis by examining the structure and summary statistics of the combined dataset. I also transformed the date and time columns into appropriate formats for further analysis. Additionally, I calculated the ride length in minutes by subtracting the start time from the end time.

To analyze the differences in bike usage between annual members and casual riders, I aggregated the ride lengths based on membership type using functions such as mean, median, max, and min. I also grouped the data by the day of the week and membership type to determine the number of rides per day for each group.

To visualize the data and present the findings, I created several plots using ggplot2. These visualizations include a bar chart showing the total number of rides per day of the week, a bar chart comparing the total number of rides per month for annual members and casual riders, and a bar chart displaying the number of rentals for each bike type based on membership type. Additionally, I created a bar chart to compare the average ride duration per day of the week for annual members and casual riders.

Stakeholders:

Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing):- As my manager, she initiated the project and is responsible for driving the growth and success of Cyclistic. Moreno will rely on the analysis and insights I provide to make data-driven marketing decisions.

Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team:- My fellow data analysts will collaborate with me to perform the analysis, extract insights, and develop recommendations based on the data. We will work together to design effective marketing strategies.

Cyclistic Executive Team:- The executive team will review and evaluate the recommendations and strategies proposed by the marketing analytics team. They will make decisions based on the analysis to drive the company's growth and profitability.

The success of this project relies on the collaboration and coordination between the marketing team, analytics team, and the executive team. The insights gained from the analysis will guide the development of targeted marketing campaigns to convert casual riders into annual members, ultimately contributing to the overall success of Cyclistic as a bike-share program.
